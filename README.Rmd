Welcome! This manual describes the principles and practices we use for managing projects. 

# Getting Started

For working with data (cleaing, analysis etc.) we primarily use R and Stata. We also use Python occasionally. 

We use Git + Github for version control and Github for task management. 

Below are some resources to get you started. 

## Project Management

- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
- [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitionerâ€™s Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf)

## R

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - this book will introduce you to R through the *tidyverse* suite of packages and introduce project management in with R/RStudio. The online version is free and you can [order a physical copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/).

## Stata
