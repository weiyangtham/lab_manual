Welcome! This manual describes the principles and practices we use for managing projects.

Getting Started
===============

For working with data (cleaing, analysis etc.) we primarily use R and Stata. We also use Python occasionally.

We use Git + Github for version control and Github for task management.

Below are some resources to get you started.

Project Management
------------------

-   [Good enough practices in scientific computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
-   [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitionerâ€™s Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf)

R
-

-   [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - this book will introduce you to R through the *tidyverse* suite of packages and introduce project management in with R/RStudio. The online version is free and you can [order a physical copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/).

Stata
-----

-   [UNC tutorial](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/tools/data_analysis/statatutorial)

Python
------

-   asdfk

Git
---

-   [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
-   [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) - despite its name, much of this resource is relevant for non-R users, especially installation and set up, which can sometimes be a pain with Git

### Git GUIs

Git can be rather abstract and hard to wrap your head around at first. A graphical user interace (GUI) can be really helpful in removing the mystique.

-   [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is sleek and works across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux
-   RStudio integrates well with Github and has a simple interface for working with Git/Github
